# Home assistant templates

## OVO "Free 3" plan with AusGrid TOU rates

1. Enable the 'Workday' integration for Australia
2. Add the code from [template.yaml](template.yaml) into your `configuration.yaml` file. _(Instead, you can also paste the contents inside the `sensor` sections into a 'Helper'->'Template' in the web interface)_
